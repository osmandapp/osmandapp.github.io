<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="permission">Why does OsmAnd require permission X</div>
<ul class="list">
  <li> Camera/Voice Recording - this is only used by the Audio/Video notes plugin. This feature is optional and by default disabled (can be enabled in the Plugin Manager). It allows to quickly create location-related audio/video notes during a trip.</li>
  <li> Read address book  - is required by the app in order to use addresses that are defined in your address book.</li>
  <li> GPS/Network access/SD card are natural requirements for this application.</li>
  <li> Billing permission - even though the free application doesn't have any in app, it was introduced to get them in and the last moment inapp was excluded. There is no reason to remove that in app because it will be needed to go through long procedure of extending permissions again.</li>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="failed_to_use_sdcard_on_4_4">How do I use my SD Card with OsmAnd under Android 4.4+ ?</div>
<div class="content">If you update your Android to version 4.4.x, you will experience a known Android issue with the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission: Android has changed the rules so that from now on no application can write to the external SD card anywhere outside its new standard folder <span class="code">Android/data/[PACKAGE-NAME]</span>. If OsmAnd was installed prior to updating your device to Android 4.4.x, it will continue to work (read-only) with the old, non-standard <span class="code">osmand</span> folder, but won't be able to update any map and other files there.
<p>Solutions:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li><u>Move OsmAnd's data folder <span class="code">osmand</span> to the internal storage.</u>
     <br/> <b>Drawback:</b> Internal storage can be rather small.</li>
  <li><u>Move OsmAnd's data folder <span class="code">osmand</span> into its standard SD folder</u>,
     <br/>for OsmAnd+ : <span class="code">(extSdCard)/Android/data/net.osmand.plus/files</span>
     <br/>for OsmAnd : <span class="code">(extSdCard)/Android/data/net.osmand/files</span>
     <br/> <b>Caution:</b> Whenever you uninstall OsmAnd now, all your data will be erased as well! (Unless you unmount your SD-Card, or rename the <span class="code">net.osmand(.plus)</span> folder before de-installation.)
</ul>
If you manually want to perform the necessary copies/moves, either use a PC to perform this action on he SD card, or via the device itself use a file manager tool <b>which came pre-installed with your Android</b>, (only these methods will have the necessary write permission).
Copies can also be invoked in OsmAnd itself via Menu/Settings/General/Data storage folder but the copy operations may take a long time or result in errors (e.g. if the SD-card is too full).

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="osmand_installation_failed">OsmAnd+ installation on the SD card fails</div>
<div class="content">
<p>This happens only for the OsmAnd+ paid version and it is a known Google Play issue (this is reproducible for other paid applications copied to SD-card). 
</p>
<p>Symptoms:<u>Application was installed on SD-card and update fails</u></p>
<p>Possible solution:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Check here http://www.newbiehelper.net/solve-couldnt-install-on-usb-storage-or-sd-card-error-in-android-2-2/</li>
  <li> If you have a running application, please make a backup</li>
  <li> Uninstall the application completely (export favorites)</li>
  <li> Clear the cache of Google Play app and unmount the SD card</li>
  <li> Re-install the app</li>
</ul>
<p>Because this issue happens before the OsmAnd app even starts, this issue cannot be fixed in OsmAnd, but needs to be fixed by Google Play. Please turn to Google Play → Help → Contact Us and report the issue there so Google can fix it. (The issue happens only for some devices and Android versions.) </p>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="importing_gpx">I have a GPX file, how do I import it into OsmAnd?</div>
<ul class="list">
  <li>You can download and open it via File Browser or Dropbox and select OsmAnd as a target application</li>
  <li>You can put it in the path <osmand_home>/tracks/(optional_sub-folder)/your_file.gpx where <osmand_home> is defined as the "Data Storage folder" property value of your configuration</li>
</ul>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="contour_lines_not_visible">Contour lines are not showing up</div>
<div class="content">Please follow these steps:
<ul class="list">
 <li> Check if the Contour Maps plugin you bought is enabled under Settings → Plugins → checkmark Contour Lines Plugin. </li>
 <li> You need to download the contour line files from the menu in Settings → Manage map files → Click Here To Download or Update Offline Data → tap the little triangle where it says "Regular Maps", and select Countour lines. </li>
 <li> Check at what zoom level they appear in Menu → Configure Screen → Show contour lines. </li>
 <li> If you additionally have hillshade layer data present, its display can independently be enabled in Menu → Map Layers → Hillshade Layer. </li>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="countour_lines_feet">Is there a way to have the Contour Lines display in feet also, instead of meters?</div>
<div class="content">Unfortunately not. This would require the generation of completely seperate contour line data with different geometry and labels.</div>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="installation_issue">I can't install or upgrade the app</div>
<div class="content">
<p>If you have an error "-25/-26/-27" please read below, otherwise please contact support.
The issue you are experiencing is now a confirmed Xiaomi MIUI's integrated antivirus fault. To avoid error "-25/-26/-27", you need to freeze the "Guard Provider" process before updating OsmAnd. Then, once updated, you can re-enable the process. There are many ways and tools to freeze a process. We suggest you to google it yourself, although some of our users used 3C Toolbox or App Master, but we leave this to your preference. </p>

<p>To freeze a process, follow these steps: go to App Manager --> Apps tab --> filter by System Apps --> select the "Guard Provider" --> tap the Manage button (bottom right, four little squares) --> Freeze.
To unfreeze, repeat the same procedure. Unfortunately "App Master" does not do freeze in the OsmAnd Free version. 3C Toolbox does the trick, but you will find the "Guard Provider" process as "com.securitycore.miui_t" under "Apps" with the filter on "System”. </p>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="routing_wrong">The route calculated does not seem correct</div>
<div class="content">In order to track down issues with wrong or sub-optimum routes, please open a new posting in <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osmand"> OsmAnd googlegroup</a> and specify as detailed as possible the following information:
<ul class="list">
  <li> What version of OsmAnd are you using, on what device?</li>
  <li> Do you use the offline maps offered within the OsmAnd app for download, or online (tile / raster) maps?</li>
  <li> If you use offline maps, tell us the exact name of the map file where the routing issue occurs, and its edition date.</li>
  <li> Tell us whether you have used OsmAnd's in-app offline routing, or any online routing provider like YOURS, OpenRouteService or OSRM.</li>
  <li> What routing profile is choosen in OsmAnd app? (car, bike, pedestrian)</li>
  <li> Please specify as exactly as possible the start and end point of your route. If possible, tell us city name and street name for each. Also a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Permalink">Permalink</a> from openstreetmap.org can be helpful.</li>
  <li> Tell us your expected routing, and how OsmAnd routes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="routing_slow">Route calculation is slow</div>
<div class="content">
<p>Please be aware that there are 2 offline routing engines in the app: a Java based approach and a "Native" (C++) routing. The Java based approach is used in 'Safe Mode', it is 10 times slower than native mode and it has strict memory limitations. If you experience it and you see messages 'Not enough memory to compute', please go to Settings → 'General' → 'Safe mode' and make sure the option is disabled.</p>

<p>For native routing there are different limitations for different phones, depending on memory &amp; processor. In general, native routing should handle &lt; 300 km routes nicely. The route calculation should take between 15 sec and 4 minutes. It is prudent to not wait much longer than 4 minutes, because most likely the program will crash. </p>

<p>The only known workaround to compute long routes is to insert waypoints. Two additional waypoints should be enough even for very long routes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="long_route">How to calculate routes longer than 250km?</div>
<div class="content">
  Many long routes (> 200-250km) cannot not be calculated by OsmAnd's offline routing engine today. If the app does not show a route after 7-8 minutes of calculation time, it is worth to considering to place waypoints (pick e.g. places on motorways). 3-4 waypoints will be enough to calculate even 1000km routes.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="tts_vs_recorded">What is the difference between tts (text to speech) and recorded voices?</div>
<div class="content">
<p>TTS (text to speech) synthesizes a voice prompt from a specified text at the time it sounds, while recorded voices need to have every command snippet pre-recorded from a human voice.</p>

<p>While tts prompts may sound a bit more "robotic" and the language selection may be limited (both depends on the tts-engine installed on your device), many 'recorded' voices have various shortcomings (missing phrases, gaps) and cannot be easily maintained because you need access to the original speakers.</p>

<p>It is suggested to use a synthesized (tts) voice like en-tts. They are much more flexible and better maintained by the project developers. They are also able to announce street names or highway numbers (version 1.5.1 and newer) etc., which pre-recorded voices cannot.</p>

<p>The output quality of tts voices strictly depends on the tts engine you select (or install) in your Android device settings (built-in or 3rd party, try a few). I suggest that recorded voices should only be a fallback if you <u>really</u> like a particular voice, or if you cannot find a tts-engine supporting your language.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="tts_not_working">TTS does not function properly (i.e. Dutch)</div>
<div class="content">If you have issues with the TTS voice guidance, please check if you have a TTS engine compatible with the language in question installed on your Android device. It is a known issue that e.g. one of Android's default TTS engines (Pico) does not support Dutch. You can try to use something like SVOX or Espeak.</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="gpx_routing_params">What do the 'Use current destination' and 'Pass along entire track' options mean when navigating using predefined GPX routes?</div>
<ul class="list">
<li>"Use current destination": Guides you via the specified GPX-track, but to your currently selected "Destination", so the GPX route can be extended or shortened.
</li>
<li>"Pass along entire track": Forces the OsmAnd navigation algorithm to, as much as possible, traverse the entire GPX track, even if shortcuts are possible or you are already near its end when you start, or already rather close to your destination before traversing the entire GPX track.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="search_by_postcode">How to search an address via postcode</div>
<div class="content">
In order to find an address by a postcode:
<ul>
 <li> Go to Search (on the start screen)</li>
 <li> Move to the second tab on top (search by address)</li>
 <li> Choose a Region</li>
 <li> Click on the City button</li>
 <li> Instead the city name fill in the postcode</li>
 <li> Choose a Street</li>
 <li> Choose a Building (not required)</li>
</ul>
Please keep in mind that OsmAnd data is based on the data from Open Street Map. This global map is built collaboratively by the Internet users. In some cases the data is not complete. If you cannot find the postcode you need, it does not always mean that the postcode is wrong. Maybe just nobody added it to the map. You can make the OSM map better by adding the missing data yourself, more info is found here: <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMaps</a>
</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="offline_search_not_complete">Offline search by address does not show all streets</div>
<div class="content">
<p>Most of these issues are map data issues and should be double-checked via <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMaps</a>. If you can see that data is present there (note that it takes some time for new OSM data to appear in OsmAnd maps), then the problem is in OsmAnd's algorithm or how that data is structured.</p>

<p>The most common issue is that streets exist but are not found in a city, and this is due to missing evidence in the OSM data to what town/city the street belongs. In OsmAnd's address search you can try the button "Search in neighbooring cities" if you do not find a street as expected.</p>

<p>To investigate this problem you can use the BinaryInspector tool from <a href="http://www.osmand.net">OsmAndMapCreator</a>, installation of which shows you exact information on what is in the obf file. Most probably you will find your street in a neighboring town. If you decide to report an issue, please specify all relevant information in its description.</p>

<p>If you want to see more detail about why these issues occur in OsmAnd's algorithms, please read <a href="http://code.google.com/p/osmand/wiki/MapAddressDataStructure">Wiki</a></p>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="house_numbers_missing">House numbers are missing</div>
<div class="content">
<p>OsmAnd uses Open Street Map (OSM) as the source of the map data.<p>

<p>This map is built colaboratively by the Internet users. There are some advantages of this approach, like changes to roads or POIs can appear very quickly. But there are also disadvantages, like missing data (house numbers as an example), as the data is not overall checked for consistency.  </p>

<p>You can make the OSM map better by adding any missing data. Infomation about OSM and how to participate is published  here: <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org"> OpenStreetMaps</a> and here: <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners_Guide_1.3">Guide</a></p>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="google_maps">Why does OsmAnd not offer access to google maps?</div>
 <div class="content">
 Firstly, OsmAnd is meant to support the OSM project and tries to go that path as far as possible. Secondly, there are licensing issues. OsmAnd cannot be distributed with google map sources, you can, however, add the tile source manually, if you know the tile source url.
 </div>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="speed_cameras">OsmAnd shows only some speed camera traps</div>
<div class="content">
Due to the geodata taken from the OpenStreetMap project there are by now two methods how speed cameras are integrated in the raw OSM data:
<ul>
<li>
  A point (called "node" in OSM terminology) of a way is tagged with "highway=speed_camera"), see OSM wiki at <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag%3Ahighway%3Dspeed_camera">highway=speed_camera</a>
  </li>
<li>
  a group of OSM data elements are joined together in a so called "relation" that contains more elements than a single node to describe the direction that is covered by the speed trap ... see <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap
  .org/wiki/Relation:enforcement">Relation:enforcement</a></li>
</ul>
Currently, OsmAnd can only make use of the elements that consists of a single node. Analyzing of relations is to come in a future release.
</div>
</div>

<div class="question">
<div class="subtitle" id="drain_too_much_power">OsmAnd seems to drain too much battery power</div>
<div class="content">
<p>There have on and off been user reports about this. We made lots of measurements and could never really reproduce it, even though under some circumstances OsmAnd is reported responsible for 90% of the battery usage. Üöease be aware that OsmAnd does not run anything in background except its Sleep mode (background service), and this needs to be specifically enabled (via OsmAnd's GPX recording or Navigation guidance functionality). If enabled, you will always see the OsmAnd sleep mode icon in the status bar (can also be stopped there). So unless the sleep mode is active, if you exit the app (go to home screen or press the Exit button), OsmAnd will stop working and will not cause any power consumption.</p>

<p>Power usage issues were reported with Android 2.3 and Android 4.0. In Android 4.0 you can double-check details of what causes how much battery drain. If you check CPU time / screen time / GPS time consumed by OsmAnd (in android's standard power manager) you will see that the numbers don't add up correctly. For example, 2 min GPS, 2 min CPU, 1 min Screen causes 30% consumption. If you have some better good evidence, please contact us.</p>

<p>PS: If you use OsmAnd for hiking or otherwise carry your device in a lose pocket where accidental pressing of the device's power switch may occur, it is also advisable to put OsmAnd to the background (by hitting the device's Home button), before putting the device to sleep. Reason: If OsmAnd's map screen is the foreground application, any accidental (unnoticed) push on the power button will not only activate the screen briefly (this is unavoidable), but may then <u>also</u> briefly activate GPS, which is quite a battery eater.</p>

<div class="subtitle" id="development">OsmAnd Development</div>
<div class="content">
<h4 class="help">How can I contribute a new language TTS voice file? </h3>
The TTS voice files (ttsconfig.p) are stored here  <a href="https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/tree/master/voice">Github voice</a>. You can fork a repository and then create pull request with your file.
<ul>
<li> Please do not use an underscore _ at the beginning of your file name.</li>
<li> Do not change the version number specified in the ttsconfig.p file, use the same number as in the ttsconfig.p file you start cloning from. This number does not denote a file version, but rather the API version that the tts uses.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Please refer to our English en-tts file for basic reference and as template, and consider to look at grammatically more complex languages like German (de-tts), Czech (cz-tts), or Slovak (sk-tts) to cover more complex statements. There should be a way to correctly produce what needs to be done - the PROLOG used in the tts-config.p files is a powerful programming language.
<br/><br/>
Regarding distribution: In the latest versions the tts voices are distributed within the app (apk) and need not / cannot be downloaded any more via the download server on the web. (Don't be confused, they still appear like downloads in the app's Offline Data Manager, but they are listed there only and contained locally). However, until the next release of OsmAnd we could put new tts-voices on our googlecode Download for manual download. The basic idea is that tts files will not be updated too frequently, so in general it is sufficient to have them distributed with each release, within the application.

<div class="subtitle" id="map_creator">Creating your own maps and OsmAndMapCreator</div>
<div class="content">
<h4 class="help" id="">OsmAndMapCreator fails with message: OutOfMemoryError </h4>
The file you try to process with OsmAndMapCreator is too large. Either try to process a smaller file, or increase the memory for OsmAndMapCreator in the .sh or .bat file. The -Xmx parameter specifies how much memory the program can consume. Settings can be different for 64bit (more than 1.5GB) and 32bit (max around 1.5GB) machines.


<h4 class="help" id="">After converting an .osm to .obf with only a POI index, the .obf is empty, although original .osm file did contain POIs. What is wrong? </h4>
It could be that a crucial tag was missing for OsmAndMapCreator to recognize a POI when you converted the osm from another source, like Garmin. If a point in the OSM file looks like this:
<xmp>
 <node id='-24' visible='true' lat='1.3094000' lon='103.7784000'>
    <tag k='created_by' v='GPSBabel-1.4.2'/>
    <tag k='name' v='Street-Soccer Court'/>
  </node>
</xmp>
change it to contain an additional 'amenity' tag, like:
<xmp>
 <node id='-24' visible='true' lat='1.3094000' lon='103.7784000'>
    <tag k='created_by' v='GPSBabel-1.4.2'/>
    <tag k='name' v='Street-Soccer Court'/>
    <tag k='amenity' v='point' />
  </node>
</xmp>
Then convert the file using OsmAndMapCreator. You can check on the OSM site what tags are good ones to use, or you can just use this amenity.


<h4 class="help" id="">How can I specify internet access proxy settings for OsmAndMapCreator?</h4>
See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/120797/how-do-i-set-the-proxy-to-be-used-by-the-jvm">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/120797/how-do-i-set-the-proxy-to-be-used-by-the-jvm</a>
Use OsmAndMapCreator.bat or OsmAndMapCreator.sh to start OsmAndMapCreator based on your operating system. Both of them invoke java, so you just need to add the -D... -D.. (i .e. -Djava.util.logging.config.file = logging.properties) params to the invokation.

<h4 class="help" id="">I want to put some custom details on a vector map (render own custom data)</h4>
OsmAndMapCreator can process only OSM files (osm-xml, bz2, pbf). However the set of tags can be custom. To specify what tags/values need to be indexed by Creator please download and change this 
file https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-core/blob/master/OsmAnd-java/src/net/osmand/osm/rendering_types.xml. 
OsmAndMapCreator has an option to use custom rendering_types.xml in the settings. Once the map file is created you can double check that data is present via the binaryInspector utility with the '-vmap' argument. This utility is packaged with OsmAndMapCreator. 
<br/><br/>
Once the .obf file is ready you can create a custom rendering file to display your custom missing attributes. There is a default rendering style which contains all information about rendering https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/rendering_styles/default.render.xml. It is good to have a look at it but it is rather hard to understand, open, and edit it. A more convenient way to create your own rendering style is to create a style that depends on (inherits from) the default style.  A good example of a custom 'depends' rendering style is https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-resources/blob/master/rendering_styles/Winter-and-ski.render.xml.
<br/><br/>
Currently OsmAndMapCreator doesn't support relation tagging. So you need to manually copy all tags from relations (like route color) to way tags by script.

<div class="subtitle" id="beta_testing">OsmAnd Beta Testing</div>
<div class="content">
The Google Play Store provides the possibility to test beta versions of apps, which enables you to (temporary) download and use the test version from the Google Play Store instead of the standard release version(s).
For OsmAnd this means that you can participate in testing the new OsmAnd free or the new OsmAnd+ paid versions. This enables you to use and test exciting new features. Of course, using a beta version also means that you might encounter bugs or app crashes.
The Google Play Store mechanism also supports the easy return to the standard version from the Google Play Store.


<h4 class="help" id="">Activating the test version </h3>
Register as tester for the OsmAnd free test version via the following Google Group:
https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.osmand
Register for the OsmAnd+ paid test version via the following Google Group:
<a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.osmand.plus/testing">Testing</a>
(note: this is only possible if you are a registered user for the paid version)
<br/><br/>
<ul>
  <li> When you click the link to register, you will see a big blue or green panel advertising "Be a test user" (in your defined language).</li>
  <li> After clicking the "button" you will see the message "You are now a tester" with a green check-mark in front of it (and on repetitive actions it will show "You are a tester").</li>
  <li> Give Google some time to synchronize which can be anywhere between 10 seconds or 60 minutes.</li>
  <li> Now you can download the test version, either directly from the Google Play Store, or via your phone/tablet.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="help" id="">Returning to the standard Google Play Store OsmAnd version </h3>
Note that the same registration screen, after having registered, also has a link "Leave the test version". 
If, after some time, you want to use the current standard release version from the Google Play Store again, proceed as follows:
<ul>
  <li> Use the above link again (so you better make this a bookmark/favorite in your browser). The page will still inform "You are a tester"</li>
  <li> The page also contains the link "Leave the test version".</li>
  <li> Click that link to then see "You have left the test version"</li>
  <li> Manually uninstall the test version, either via the Google Play Store or on your phone/tablet.</li>
  <li> Manually (re)install the current version, either via the Google Play Store or on your phone/tablet.</li>
</ul>


<b>Note</b>: Before changing to the test version, perform an export of your OsmAnd favorites. The new test version should simply continue using the favorites but as it is a beta version for testing, you never know.
