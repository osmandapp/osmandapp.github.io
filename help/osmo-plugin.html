<ul>
<li class="help">The OSM Advanced Live Monitoring plugin provides a variety of features. It is comparable with Google Latitude or other live tracking services, helping to share your location with friends.</li>
<p class="img"><img class="help" src="images/osmo/osmo-plugin.png" /></p>
<li class="help"> Once the plugin is activated you will see new widget on the screen, which shows whether you are connected to the service. </li>
<p class="img"><img class="help" src="images/osmo/widget.png" /></p>
<li class="help"> In order to connect/disconnect, join a group, or share your location with friends please tap on the widget.</li>
<p class="img"><img class="help" src="images/osmo/osmo-activity.png" /></p>
This screen provides various functions. The 'OsMo service' box indicates whether you are connected to the service.<br>
'Send my locations' - shows whether or not you send your locations to the server. If you do not send your locations, you are in a stealth mode: No one can see your location, while you can still see all available locations.<br>
Below that the groups of devices are displayed. "Connected devices" is the special group of the devices you connected manually. In order to join other groups, use the "Connect to" dialogue.
<br/>
Every line displays a device and the direction to it, distance to it, and the last location update time. Tapping on any line invookes that device's context menu.

<li class="help"> In order to make a peer to peer connection, you just need to know your "Tracker Id". Click Settings on the OsMo screen and select "Tracker Id". Now you can share it with a friend.

Please note that this creates a permanent connection. In order to reset it, you need to perform "Regenerate Tracker Id" in the settings and all your listeners will be removed.</li>
<li class="help"> If you want to share only 1 session peer to peer, just select "Share" -> "Share current session" on the OsMo screen.</li>
<p class="img"><img class="help" src="images/osmo/share-session.png" /></p>
<li class="help"> If you receive a link to join a group or to connect a device, just click on it and OsmAnd will perform the respective action automatically. If this fails, you can still join group or connect a device manually by, on the OsMo screen, clicking "Connect To" and entering the alphabetic code.</li>
<p class="img"><img class="help" src="images/osmo/link-with-device.png" /></p>
<li class="help"> To track a user or device on the map, you can select it from the OsMo screen and chose "Show on Map". You can also set a device "As a Moving Target" so you can continuously watch the distance to it or even see updated navigation instructions.</li>
