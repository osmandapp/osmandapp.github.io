<p>You may want to find the nearest location of a certain type, view your own location or search for a place by zip code. Just use the guide below.</p>
<p>Please note: to accomplish some of these tasks (locate addresses, POI, etc.) you will need to have the offline vector map file.</p>
<p>In the Search option there are three tabs (from left to right):</p>

<p><b>History</b> – shows all your search history</p>
<p><b>Categories</b> – used for finding specific places of interest (museums, landmarks, etc.)</p>
<p><b>Address</b> - for searching by an address. This tab for Android version offers 4 more options, for iOS version offers 2 options:</p>
<ul class="textlist">
<li>Street and City (you can enter city, street and building number step by step)</li>
<li>Postcode – for finding your location by a zipcode</li>
<li>Coordinate search – offers different coordinate formats.</li>
 </ul>

<div class="subtitle" id="Find_your_own_position_A"><h2>Find your own position</h2></div>
<div class="blocksubtitle">Android</div>
<p>Enable GPS or network positioning and wait while the device discovers your position.
Once done, you have to press the &#39;target&#39; button in the lower right corner of the map acreen and the map will be zoomed to your area and centered to your location. A light blue disk around your position marker indicates there is inaccuracy of the position detection due to geometric factors. You can also enable displaying your current viewing direction, which will follow any device rotation if your device is equipped with compass sensors. You may want to go to Settings - General - Kalman filter to reduce noise in compass readings.</p>
<p><b>Technical note:</b> The blue disk depicts the reported "accuracy" of the position fix. This is <b>not</b> the same as an uncertainty radius (or "precision") of your position on the map, but rather just an indicator for how useful positioning data is being received (scatter). The "true" position may actually be systematically outside the disk indicated due to many factors like reflection, ionospheric corrections etc., but this measurement "precision" cannot usually be estimated from just the data. The "viewing direction" cone depicts the direction the device's 'up' axis is pointed to, its length and opening angle have no meaning assigned.</p>
<div class="blocksubtitle" id="Find_your_own_position_I">iOS</div>
<p>All you need to do is press the target icon on the main screen and if the app asks for a permission to use the location, press Allow. Finding the position often takes seconds.</p>
