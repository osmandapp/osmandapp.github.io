<h1>Planning your trip</h1>
<p>Using OsmAnd, you can plan your trip, build new or use ready routes.</p>
<h2>Planning your trip with Navigation option</h2>
<p>You can create a new route using the Navigation option of the app. This tool is designed to help you find an optimal route according to your vehicle, personal requirements, etc. You can choose a car, bicycle or pedestrian mode, choose to avoid certain types of roads, etc. As soon as the route is build, you'll get a turn-by-turn voice guidance.
If you'd like to save the track of your movement, just turn the Trip recording plugin on and start a new GPX track before you proceed.</p>
