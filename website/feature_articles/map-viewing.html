<p>OsmAnd gives you great possibilities for using the maps. You can customize them, download different types of maps and even edit them!</p>
<p>We recommend you download the World basemap before proceeding. You can then move on to downloading the map of your region or the one you're planning to travel to. OsmAnd uses the Open Street Maps, the maps made by the open-source project, a community of volunteer contributors who work on the maps every day.
This is why they are so up-to-date. They&#39;re also quite compact and rapidly rendered as the basic OsmAnd map is a vector-type map, which means it carries vector representation of the map details rendered together on your device as opposed to the tile or raster maps that are&#39;pictures&#39;.</p>
<h2>Customize your map</h2>
<p>As you open the map, you'll be able to customize its view in may different ways.</p>
<h2>Show the details</h2>
<p>You can choose what exactly you'd like to see on the map in terms of additional details. To do that, just tap Configure screen, then go to the Show section. There, you'll be able to choose POI, Point labels, Favorites and GPX tracks to be added to the map.</p>
<h2>Map rendering</h2>
<p>You can choose your map style. It is set to OsmAnd by default, but you can pick the one that fits your needs. &#39;Nautical&#39; and &#39;Winter and ski&#39; styles are made to be used with the corresponding plugins.</p>
<p>You can also choose the day or night map regime, select the map magnifier parameters to view details more comfortably, choose text size and map language. Please note that the map language sets the language to view the names on the map. You can set it to Local names to see the names in the language of that area. To change the app language, go to Settings - General - Localization.</p>
<p>The Details menu provides other details like the quality of the road surface and even the street lighting while the Hide menu helps you hide certain sections of data from the map. You can also view the routes available in the Routes section.</p>
<p>Other map attributes menu will help you customize the view by adding even more details to the map, but if you want to change the screen options like destination, speed limit, etc., choose Configure screen menu.</p>
