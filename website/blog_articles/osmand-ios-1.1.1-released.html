<h2>OsmAnd 1.1.1. for iOS</h2>
<div class="date">July 2, 2015</div>
<p>A new OsmAnd version for iOS is here! The update includes a convenient plugin, more improvements in the POI area and a nicer UI. But let&amp;s discuss every feature in detail.</p>

<h2>Offline Contour Lines Maps</h2>
<p>This plugin, being much appreciated by Android users, is now available in the iOS version. It provides you with quite detail info on the terrain of a certain location and the heights. To get the plugin, just go to the in-app purchase area.</p>

<h2>POI improvements &amp; Wikipedia</h2>
<p>The POI information has become even fuller: now you can see the opening hours of a location, its phone number and website. Besides that, we thought it would be nice to add the possibility to get Wikipedia information offline, so now you can read about your favorite POI on the go.</p>

<h2>Trip recording</h2>
<p>In the new version, there&#39;s the ability to add new waypoints to track. While you record the track, you can add waypoints by making a long tap. You can also add them to a newly-created track without recording.</p>
