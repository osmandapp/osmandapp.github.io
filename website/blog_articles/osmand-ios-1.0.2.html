<h2>POI and Favorites</h2>
<p>POI is a so called “point of interest”. It can be any object on the map, like a restaurant, a parking area, an institution or a cash machine. POIs are split into categories. You can show all POIs from selected categories on the map (like all restaurants together with cash machines) as well as search the objects which are near-by by category as well as by name (like you what to go to a particular restaurant or what to see where is the nearest cash machine is).</p>
